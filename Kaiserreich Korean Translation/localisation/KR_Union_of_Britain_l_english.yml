### Focuses ###
ENG_tuc:0 "1936년 노동조합 회의"
ENG_tuc_desc:0 "This years' TUC will probably be a bit special - long-time Chairman Philip Snowden has indicated that he intends to resign. The decentralisationist Autonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralisationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley) and Status Quo Federationists (Arthur Horner) with his egalitarian & pacifist running mate Annie Kenney are all vying for superiority. These will be nights to remember..."
ENG_tuc_economy:0 "경제 정책"
ENG_tuc_economy_desc:0 "On this day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions.

ENG_tuc_internal:0 "국내 정책"
ENG_tuc_internal_desc:0 "On this day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."

ENG_political_commissars:0 "정치 장교"
ENG_political_commissars_desc:0 "Sometimes, even the most diligent Syndicalist needs a small reminder of his duties. Sometimes, that reminder should be given from behind a revolvers' sights."

ENG_dissolve_tuc:0 "TUC 해체"
ENG_dissolve_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Union Congress has served its part. By now, it has changed from a symbol of the Syndicalist dream to a symbol of Centralist repression.

ENG_revolution_desc:0 "This whole 'reforming the country' business has turned out to be very boring. We can attempt one swift strike to totally seize the means of politics and make our political program a reality. This will be risky, though."

But we can rely on a doctrine well-tested: Simply build as many as the next two together. More Fighters! More Bombers!"
ENG_air21:0 "전장 통제"

uob.0.t:0 "The new Britain"
uob.0.d:0 "After the defeat of France, the United Kingdom's war with Germany dragged on inconclusively for two years. In 1921, the stalemate was finally broken when Lloyd-George agreed to the German proposal of a "Peace with Honour". While Britain's overseas territories remained largely intact, the faith of the people did not. \n\nIn 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute in the coalfields of South Wales quickly escalated, and after six weeks of rioting, looting and pamphleteering, most of the "establishment", including the Royal Family, had fled to Canada. A provisional government of revolutionary groups dissolved what little was left of Parliament, and declared a new "Union of Britain".\n\nFifteen years later, the Trade Union Congress still forms the centrepiece of politics of the federated and democratic Union. The British people are secure on their island, content to build socialism in isolation, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police. \n\nYet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
uob.1.t:0 "Vote for economic policy"
uob.1.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."

uob.1.b:0 "Fed.: The economy must be expanded and centralised"
uob.1.c:0 "Aut.: Greater economic autonomy must be given to the Home Nations"
uob.2.t:0 "Vote for internal policy"

uob.2.a:0 "Max.: The local governments must be brought in line with the TUC"
uob.2.b:0 "Fed.: The current system is satisfactory"
uob.2.c:0 "Aut.: Decentralisation - perhaps even local TUC's for the Home Nations"
uob.3.t:0 "Defecting Officers"
uob.3.d:0 "In light of the recent demonstration of political freedom on our Island some Royalist officers have defected to us - namely Adm. Willis, Gen. Hutton and Weltkrieg Hero Gen. Alexander. They could help the Republican Army and Navy with their expertise. However, while we don't have any proof there is suspicion that some of them may have fought against the Workers in the Second Glorious Revolution."
uob.3.a:0 "The Congress will decide on their fate"
uob.4.t:0 "Vote for military policy"
uob.4.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."

uob.5.b:0 "Fed.: Canada is our mortal enemy, and France is our good friend"
uob.5.c:0 "Aut.: We must take a position of reconciliation towards the Royalists"
uob.6.t:0 "The Resignation of Philip Snowden"
uob.6.d:0 "On the last day of the TUC congress Chairman Philip Snowden climbed up to the podium and made a speech. He claimed that in face of massive rifts within the TUC and due to his age he intends to resign his post. He also pulled out the cliche 'time with the family' bit that all politicians do. The congregation stood silent as he climbed down from the podium and made his way out of the hall. The country is shocked and in a few days' time the TUC will have to vote on a new chairman."
uob.6.a:0 "Shocking, to say the least"
uob.7.t:0 "Chairman Election - Maximists Secure a Majority"

uob.10.t:0 "Chairman Election - Maximists Secure no Majority"

uob.14.ac:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Kenney"
uob.14.ad:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Horner"
uob.15.t:0 "Show of Force"
uob.15.d:0 "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval manoeuvre near Ireland or even further west wards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organise countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commissar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."
uob.15.a:0 "Keep the fleet in our territorial waters"
uob.15.b:0 "Send the Grand Fleet towards Ireland"
uob.15.c:0 "Divide the fleet and perform manoeuvres near the Azores and Iceland"
uob.16.t:0 "British Fleet Manoeuvres"
uob.16.d:0 "The British navy has steamed out of its ports and has assembled to demonstrate its power against our neutral island.

uob.106.t:0 "The Exchequer's post"
uob.106.d:0 "With Mosley securing his power in the TUC, he has to make up his mind about the Exchequer's office. His retaining his post would create a concentration of power that is not only prohibited by the Union's constitution but may also affect the quality of Maximist rule.

uob.107.d:0 "The Republican Air Force has in the last few years gone through major restructuring and is now once again an effective air force. One question, however, remains; That of its doctrine. Leading theorists have identified three major categories of possible instructions for our pilots and all have proponents. Arthur Harris, a Rhodesian comrade, who came to the Union after the German occupation of his chosen home, is speaking for Strategic Destruction, Arthur Tedder speaks for Battlefield Support while the infamous John Chamier wants Operational Integrity."

uob.108.t:0 "A new Lee Enfield?"
uob.108.d:0 "The rifles supplied by the factories formerly owned by Lee Enfield still constitute the overwhelming majority of our infantry weapons. However, at least under gun connoisseurs, the weapons produced by the Birmingham Small Arms Factory have the reputation of being more suitable for offensive manoeuvres and change might be in order. A third option would be to not prefer one of the both and keep the Republican Army flexible instead."
uob.108.a:0 "Another trusty Enfield."
uob.108.b:0 "Give Birmingham a chance!"
uob.108.c:0 "Stay flexible!"

uob.150.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence offers his services"
uob.150.d:0 "Veteran agitator and aid to the Arab Revolt in the Great War T.E. Lawrence has kept a low profile in the Union so far. However, three years ago he narrowly avoided death in a motorcycle accident that ended years of aimless wandering through life. Today he approached Army High Command and offered to train as an agitator to help European Syndicalists rise up during the eventual war with Germany."
uob.150.a:0 "Lawrence shall be valuable in spreading the revolution"
uob.150.b:0 "We don't trust him - where are his Socialist credentials?"
uob.151.t:0 "Send Lawrence to Germany?"
uob.151.d:0 "T.E. Lawrence has asked permission to be air-dropped behind German lines and rendezvous with Syndicalist leaders in the Rhine and Saarland regions of Germany to raise raiding parties and potentially a revolt."
uob.151.a:0 "Good luck, Lawrence of Germania!"
uob.151.b:0 "We cannot spare the funds"
uob.152.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence is back and raising hell!"
uob.152.d:0 "Our commanders in the Saarland and Rhineland regions indicate that the former scourge of the Ottomans, T.E. Lawrence, along with other agitators and agents, is travelling through the countryside and working with local underground Syndicalist movements to sabotage elements of German industry! They must be stopped at once!"
uob.152.a:0 "Damn you, Lawrence of Germania!"
uob.153.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence has moved north!"
uob.153.d:0 "That damned T.E. Lawrence is continuing to cause trouble, growing bolder as he moves his band of reds (who are blending in with the civilian population irritatingly well) into our northern Rhineland cities. He cannot be allowed to carry on!"
uob.153.a:0 "Damn you, Lawrence of Germania!"
uob.154.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence has moved east!"
uob.154.d:0 "That damned T.E. Lawrence is continuing to cause trouble, growing bolder as he moves his band of reds (who are blending in with the civilian population irritatingly well) into our central industrial cities. The chief of the Reich's security services has promised the Kaiser this will be the last time he and his 'merry men' can wreak havoc in this way. They have set a trap for him in Dresden."
uob.154.a:0 "Damn you, Lawrence of Germania!"
uob.155.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence has barely escaped with his life!"
uob.155.d:0 "German security forces snapped their trap on Comrade Lawrence while he and German Syndicalist fighters, one of them the writer Bertolt Brecht, were planting bombs in a factory in Dresden. While Lawrence managed to escape to the coast where a French submarine was able to take him back to Britain he was shot in the leg and can no longer walk without a cane. His time as an agitator is over, but his time as a Syndicalist hero has only just begun."
uob.155.a:0 "Hoorah for Lawrence of Germania!"
uob.155.b:0 "Good enough."
uob.156.t:0 "T.E. Lawrence has been killed!"
uob.156.d:0 "German security forces snapped their trap on Comrade Lawrence while he and local Syndicalist fighters were planting bombs in a factory in Dresden. While Lawrence managed to secure the escape of his fellow revolters he was shot square in the chest and died on the spot. His time as an agitator is over, but his time as a Syndicalist hero has only just begun."
uob.156.a:0 "To absent friends! Hoorah for Lawrence of Germania!"
uob.156.b:0 "Good."
uob.157.t:0 "Counterrevolution in Britain!"
uob.157.d:0 "The Syndicalist experiment in Britain is over! The military, commanded by the war hero T.E. Lawrence, also known as 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Lawrence of Germania' has taken control. The background of the coup is unclear; It seems that infighting between the wings of the Syndicalist government is involved. Lawrence has called for an immediate cease-fire at all fronts, he wants to bring the British troops back home and begin the process of reinstating the monarchy."
uob.157.a:0 "Hoorah for Lawrence of Britannia!"
uob.157.b:0 "Damn him!"
uob.157.c:0 "The nightmare is over!"
uob.158.t:0 "What now?"
uob.158.d:0 "Interim Chairman Lawrence has never been comfortable ruling a socialist nation such as ours. A good man and loyal Briton at heart, he was more at home agitating foreign peoples than overseeing five-year plans. Comrade Wintringham approached him and asked if he will allow a Congress to meet as soon as possible and establish a new civilian government - or maybe he has other ideas..."
uob.158.a:0 "Lawrence is secretly a Monarchist and launches a counter-revolution!"
uob.158.b:0 "Civilians? Pah! Though this socialism thing is growing on me..."
uob.158.c:0 "The Federationists secure the majority."

uob.205.t:0 "TUC debate stalled"
uob.205.d:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions has stalled in a fruitless debate over a proposed Maximist law. Comrade Blair has proposed to hold a speech in a few days - while he is known as a gifted public speaker he is not an orthodox Maximist and might smuggle in some of his own points..."
uob.205.a:0 "Comrade Blair was always a good speaker..."

uob.209.t:0 "Opposition leaders elude capture"
uob.209.d:0 "Today Maximist-led army units broke into private homes all over the Union. Instead of the opposition leaders they hoped to arrest, however, they found only empty houses. Our enemies had been warned."
uob.209.a:0 "Damn Counter-revolutionaries!"
uob.210.t:0 "Maximists take over"
uob.210.d:0 "Today, we have worked closely together with loyal Army elements to take control of all important locations throughout the Union. Resistance is non-existent; We have won."

uob.211.t:0 "Resistance against Maximist take-over"
uob.211.d:0 "Today we have worked closely together with loyal Army elements to take control of all important locations throughout the Union. However, on many streets and courtyards we have encountered open and armed resistance. If we don't act soon this resistance could organise itself."

uob.214.t:0 "The morning afterwards"

uob.215.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.215.d:0 "Yesterday the British Congress of Trade Union has passed the 'Enabling Control Bill', passing quasi-dictatorial powers over to the government of Oswald Mosley. The Union of Britain has been transformed into a Maximist country."

uob.216.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.216.d:0 "Yesterday the British Congress of Trade Union has passed the 'Enabling Control Bill', passing quasi-dictatorial powers over to the government of Oswald Mosley.

uob.218.t:0 "Maximist Revolution"
uob.218.d:0 "Yesterday British Republican Army units arrested many prominent leaders of the opposition against the government lead by Oswald Mosley.

uob.220.d:0 "Yesterday British Republican Army units tried to arrest many prominent leaders of the opposition against the government lead by Oswald Mosley. However, many had left their homes and gone undercover after having been tipped off by sources inside the armed forces. There are also as-of-yet unconfirmed reports of many of them openly marching into the assembly hall of the Trade Union Congress under the massive cheers of anti-Mosley demonstrators, only leaving after being handcuffed at the speakers table to the "boos" of the assembly.

uob.223.d:0 "Yesterday the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat after martial law had been declared by the Chairman.

uob.224.d:0 "This morning the British Republican Army marched out of its barracks and into the streets of the Union securing important buildings and installations against an unnamed counter-revolutionary threat.

uob.356.t:0 "Time for a change in leadership?"
uob.356.d:0 "Comrade Mosley saluted the Congress on their wise decisions so far.

uob.358.a:0 "The Maximist Mosley and his protege Jack Jones win the top jobs."

uob.359.d:0 "Comrade Horner saluted the Congress on their wise decisions so far.

Federationists may have to rely on an old ally to win the day..."
uob.359.a:0 "Horner elevates G.D.H. Cole to General Secretary."

uob.359.d:0 "Barbara Castle and James Maxton make a pact!"
uob.360.t:0 "No more Home Rule"
uob.360.d:0 "Now that the Maximists rule over the Union of Britain, they should realise their promise of limiting Home Rule once again. But while this promise has quite the following in the halls of London and other English cities, protests and demonstrations have been staged by our enemies already - and they will only grow stronger if we follow through..."
uob.360.a:0 "It shall be done!"
uob.360.b:0 "Maybe this wasn't the best idea..."
uob.361.t:0 "A cold, wet day for Eric Blair"
uob.361.d:0 "Comrade Eric Blair, once an ally of Grand Protector Mosley, could not stand it any longer. For too long the evil Mosley had perverted the constitution and made the Union of Britain his plaything. A popular writer and skilled militia commander, Blair alone has the authority to bring down the tyrant. As Blair stared out into the rain today, he knew he had to take action."
uob.361.a:0 "His Populist coup is successful!"
uob.361.b:0 "He brings in the military!"
uob.361.c:0 "Mosley sniffs out the coup!"
uob.362.t:0 "A cold, wet day"
uob.362.d:0 "Early this morning, the popular writer and skilled militia commander Eric Blair was found dead in his home after obviously having committed suicide. While officially no testament has been found, it is an open secret that Blair was no longer an ally of Grand Protector Mosley. \n\n As the 'improvised' demonstration in his honour slowly and quietly heads through the streets of London, ever more people are joining, many with tears in their eyes; Some weep for the man, some for the last hope against Mosley's dictatorship."

Now, however, the Mid-England Rail Syndicate has reported that for the past few months, anonymous letters have started arriving, always containing the correct solutions to the last crossword puzzle. Whoever is writing these letters must be some sort of genius - and could probably be of help to us..."

uobflavour.2.t:0 "Wrapped in a mystery"
uobflavour.2.d:0 "It took quite some time, but our intelligence services finally managed to find the man who still regularly solves the hardest crossword puzzles in the country with ease. His name is Alan Turing, a math professor before the revolution, currently living in London. He first tried to evade our men, but after some time, calmed down. And in fact, he already had a project in mind when our scientists asked what kind of research we could assist and support him in. It all seems very technical, and, more importantly, hideously expensive, but our experts assure us that this Turing might be on the right path to something extraordinary..."

The small project of this Turing, over time grown into a whole village near the former cottage at Bletchley Park, has finally seen success. He has constructed a strange machine, called 'Pudding' after the Yorkshire pudding Turing was enjoying when he had the idea, that has revolutionised cryptography. For the first time, military encryption and decryption are conducted by a machine. This will give the Union an important edge in any military conflict."

The charter also claims the socialist state is the final stage of human development and that democracy is not necessary to achieve socialism. These statements have drawn great criticisms from other socialist factions, who gave it the name "Totalism" as a play on totalitarian socialism, which has been eagerly accepted by Mosely who added it to the manifesto's name, attributing it to their total commitment to socialism. All present politicians and philosophers have signed the manifesto entitled 'The Totalist Charter', available in all appropriate languages."

Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views. They have also made themselves quite popular with drafts for Unionised Living Space for poorer comrades. \n\nThe artistic world of the Union is divided as sculptors, potters and writers deny having to do anything with those architects, and a clear path must be set.

As a result, it became one of the last holdouts of royalists in London, and was destroyed by fire during the Revolution. The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."

ENG_militia_idea_desc:0 "The British military is still largely organised in the impromptu worker's militias of 1925. While these local militias have a high morale, they seem disregardful for some of the finer concepts for warfare, such as the need for working logistics. Due to their deafening cries of 'Break the chains! Break the chains!', our officers routinely suffer from psychological breakdowns."

### Minister Bios ###
ENG_horner_desc:0 "Arthur Horner was born in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, the eldest surviving son of a family of seventeen children only six of whom lived past infancy. Horner's father was a chargehand porter in the railway goods station. His maternal grandfather and two maternal uncles were miners. His earliest employment was as a grocer's assistant and delivery boy in the coalfield communities around Merthyr. After a short spell in Merthyr railway goods station he was drawn into coal mining employment in 1915 due to his growing interest in the political radicalism of trade union activists in the nearby Rhondda coalfield. \n Horner's first political affiliation was socialist and Keir Hardie, who had been elected MP for Merthyr Tydfil in 1900, his first political hero. After he had joined the Independent Labour Party in Merthyr, Horner moved to the colliery village of Ynyshir in the Rhondda where he became a protégé of Noah Ablett, trade union militant, executive member of the South Wales Miners Federation and also convener of local classes in Marxist education which Horner attended. During this period Horner gradually relinquished the strong Christian faith of his teenage years during which he had been baptised into the Churches of Christ. This small but intellectually inclined Protestant sect, had recognised his potential talent as a preacher and financed a period of training for him as a lay evangelist from which he gained considerable confidence in public speaking and debate. \n Opposing the Weltkrieg from the standpoint of class solidarity, in 1917 he fled to Dublin to avoid arrest for ignoring his call-up papers. Horner was a supporter of demands for Irish home-rule and became involved with the rebel factions from the 1916 Easter Rising, joining the Irish Citizen Army. On his return to Britain he was arrested by the authorities for avoiding conscription and sentenced to six months hard labour at Wormwood Scrubs. After he had served his sentence he was refused the amnesty made available after the war to most conscientious objectors, rearrested and sent to Camarthen jail. The SWMF campaigned for his release and to this end secured his election in absentia as checkweighman at Mardy Colliery, one of the most militant collieries in the Rhondda valleys. To add to the pressure on the authorities Horner began a hunger strike, refusing both food and water. After six days this combination of tactics secured his release in May 1919. Horner then went on to play an active role in the 1925 British Revolution."
