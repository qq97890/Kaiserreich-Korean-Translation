combinedsyndicates.3.c:0 "1 Year Plan"
combinedsyndicates.4.t:0 "Land and agricultural reforms"
combinedsyndicates.4.d:0 "Land and agricultural reforms were a hot button issue for the Syndicates. Would they implement a harsh program of collectivisation administered directly by the central government? Or would they allow for local syndicates to manage farmers? Another proposal would allow for farmers to have some guaranteed prices and also allow limited market involvement."
combinedsyndicates.4.a:0 "Start the Collectivisation process."

combinedsyndicates.15.a:0 "Blasted Reactionaries"
combinedsyndicates.16.t:0 "Violence throughout the South"
combinedsyndicates.16.d:0 "The racial tension that had been at the boiling point, boiled over, and erupted into violence. Groups of whites and blacks attacked each other as the local councils were unable to contain the issue. Tensions ran high as the South began to burn.

combinedsyndicates.22.d:0 "The first day of debates have resulted in three plans to set up the government. The first is put forth by William Z. Foster which posits that there should be a centralised congress with the states having little to no power. This drew immediate ire from the Unionists which countered with their own plan based around decentralised power. A delegate from the Federalists stepped forward with a third plan that tries to be a balanced though both argue it is not revolutionary enough and is just the old US government with a new name."

The Centralists counter that only with a strong executive can the American worker be protected from reactionaries. Once again the Federalists faction has them playing the centre trying to balance the two factions and argue for a strong executive but one with plenty of checks and balances and a separation of powers to prevent him or her from being a dictatorship."

While Centralists countered with a strong top down bureaucracy that could help America with the federal government being able to fund education much better then a decentralised model.

The movement is emphatically catholic but it is also emphatically an anarchist movement. The growth of the Catholic Workers Movement is concerning to the Vatican leadership who view it as a deviating it from Catholic Doctrine. However despite this, most think that the best way to handle it is to ignore it as most pious Catholics will stay true to the Church's teachings. While others think that an Encyclical against the movement would destroy it in the crib. While finally a small few think supporting the movement can allow the Catholic Church to turn it away from Syndicalism and as a force for good."

combinedsyndicates.305.d:0 "With Reconstruction on the way Charlie Chaplin and the United Artist Union have released yet another hit. His new movie, God Save the Kaiser, is considered by man to be his best movie to date. God Save the Kaiser is a political satirical comedy-drama and Chaplin's first true sound films. The film follows two principal characters, an unnamed German barber struggling to make ends meet in Germany who bears a great deal of similarity with the Tramp that Chaplin played in his other movies. The other major character is Kaiser Fredrick who is a bumbling but cruel buffoon of a leader; an obvious satire of Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Throughout the film it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the kaiser in particular. The Film ends with the barber being mistaken for Kaiser and giving a rousing speech where he extols the virtues of Good will and Human Brotherhood and gives a strong endorsement for Chaplin's Radical Socialist views."
